# Tarpaulin
The API for this project is Tarpaulin, a lightweight course management tool that’s an “alternative” to Canvas. The project was created with the help of Joesph Babal, John Nguyen, and Jason Ho in the course: CS 493 Cloud Development. Cloned from the original repo and made public for portfolio.
